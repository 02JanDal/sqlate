Some of the tests need a database to be run, so a test database server is needed or they will fail.
Curently the requirements are:
- Postgres database running at "sqlate-postgres" address if run from ctest/make test or on localhost if run manually
- Postgres must accept non-encrypted connections to the default port 5432
- there must be an account "sqlate.user" with password "sql123456" and having superuser rights (so it is better to use an isolated test postgres install)
- there must be an "sqladmins" and "sqlusers" group and the "sqlate.user" must be part of them. "sqladmins" should have wide rights (e.g superuser rights)
